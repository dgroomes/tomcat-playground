ðŸ“š Learning and exploring Apache Tomcat.

> ### Apache Tomcat

## Overview

While Tomcat is old and certainly has a dated appearance, it is still widely used, actively maintained and is even on
the cutting edge of the Java ecosystem with its support for the latest versions of the Jakarta EE specifications and
experimental support for Java virtual threads. I'd like to learn it by directly using its API. The `tomcat-playground`
project is a place for me to do that.

This might turn into more of a servlet playground than a Tomcat playground. We'll see.

**NOTE**: This project was developed on macOS. It is for my own personal use.


## Instructions

Follow these instructions to build and run the example program.

1. Use Java 17
2. Start the demo program and web server
    * ```shell
      ./gradlew run
      ```
3. Open the browser
    * Let's see the final effect by opening the browser to <http://localhost:8080/message>. You should see a special
      message from the server.
4. Stop the server
    * When you're ready, stop the demo program and server with the `Ctrl+C` key combination.


## Wish List

General clean-ups, TODOs and things I wish to implement for this project:

* [x] DONE Implement the project. Do the minimum to run an embedded Tomcat server (I'm not very interested in
  a non-embedded Tomcat server at this time. I'm not sure that I'm using the right words).
* [x] DONE Clean up the logging. Is Tomcat logging via SLF4J?
* [ ] Consider exploring servlets just a little bit
* [ ] Consider exploring Tomcat's support for Java virtual threads
* [ ] Serve a static file (we love static content, let's have a working example).
* [ ] Set the file stuff to a temp directory or something. I'm seeing a `tomcat.8080` directory in the project root.
